# AnyWrapped

This is a python app for desktop, for tracking music player applications to build usage statistics. This app aims to be a
"port" of the concept of spotify wrapped, made available for other music player apps.

Music players supported right now:
- AIMP

Roadmap:
- Real graphical user interface
- Allow the user to edit the database from the app
- Generate a Spotify Wrapped style image with stats
- Maybe tracking reproduction time, asides number of reproductions
- Support more music players:
- - Winamp
- - VLC Media Player
- - Audacious
- - Ironically Spotify??? if theres a python wrapper library for spotify.
